    <h1>Process book </h1>
    <div> This storybook represents my trip from Toronto to Montreal </div>
    <div> The first I wanted to represent the key 2 cities which is Toronto and Montreal</div>
    <div> I used Figma to draw the skyline of the 2 cities </div>
    <div> Then I draw the major train stops Union Station and Gare Central </div>
    <div> I wanted to add some visual elements such as the stars and towers using shapes </div>
    <div>I used Yellow colour as a negviation tool </div>
    <div>I used a Figma plugin to convert the drawings into a html code </div>
    <div> I struggled a bit with hyperlinking objects , then it made me understand the importance of the different tags used </div>
    <div> The last page of the story book , I drew a croissant using shapes and strokes </div>

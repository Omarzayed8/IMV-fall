          <p>
           
           Choosing the website design for this content involves maximizing informativeness. It necessitates striking a delicate balance between visual elements and the information presented on the poster.

                Animation:I animated a watermelon, employing it as a symbol with historical significance for Palestinians. 
                This symbolism dates back to 1967, a pivotal year when Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza, annexing East Jerusalem. 
                Subsequently, the Israeli government, through a military order, criminalized public displays of the Palestinian flag in Gaza and the West Bank. T
                o circumvent this prohibition, Palestinians ingeniously turned to watermelons. When sliced open, this fruit vividly mirrors the patriotic colors of the Palestinian flag: red flesh, black seeds, white rind, and green outer skin.
            </li>
            <li>Fonts: I integrated three distinct fonts into the project. The initial choice was the Fit Variable Font, specifically selected for headlines. 
                For the Arabic text, I opted for the Lifta font, a bold protest typeface available in both black and stencil versions. This font is named after the Palestinian village of Lifta, which suffered destruction during the 1948 occupation. 
                Designed by Omaima Dajani, a resident of East Jerusalem currently living under occupation, this typeface serves as a visual protest against the erasure of Palestinian identity and the ongoing subjugation of their rights.
                To complement the design, paragraphs were styled using Font 2, skillfully crafted by my friend Nicole Pitsitikas.
            <li>Contents: Providing a suffcient overview of the historical and present context of Palestine and the predicament of Palestinian refugees, this piece also outlines the key aspirations articulated by the Palestinian people. 
                Additionally, a hyperlink directs readers to an educational reading list, offering an opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of Palestine and its ongoing occupation.

            <h2>Prototype and challanges </h2>
            <p>I encountered several challenges during the creative process, with a primary focus on achieving a smooth aesthetic in the sketch and strategically positioning the video for a directed visual impact. 
              Additionally, there was a concurrent effort to comprehend and optimize the underlying code, aiming for cleanliness and improved efficiency in the programming structure.  </p>

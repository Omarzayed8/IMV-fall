        <h2>  Historical background </h2>
        <p>Palestine has a long and vast history. First documented in ancient Egyptian tablets as Peleset over 3000 years ago, the region between the Mediterranean and the river Jordan has come to mean many different things to many different peoples.
            Throughout the ages, Palestine has been home to dozens of cultures, kingdoms and empires. From Assyrian and Nabataean, to Persian and Roman -and many more- each influencing as well as being influenced by the rich cultural and civilizational mélange that defined the area. 
            These ancient influences can still be felt today in the idioms, vocabulary and toponymy used by its native Palestinian population.
             Even Palestinian agricultural practices can be traced back to the Natufians -one of the peoples credited with inventing agriculture- who called Palestine and the fertile crescent their home, as far back as 9,000 BCE.

       <h2>Refugees</h2>
       <br>
       <p>The mass displacement of Palestinians began with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948,
         leading to a series of conflicts between Arab states and Israel. 
        The Nakba (Catastrophe) resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes.
        Today, there are nearly 7 million Palestinian refugees around the world.</p>

        <h3>Calls for change</h3>
        <br>
        <pl>Palestinians have a range of demands, primarily centered around achieving self-determination and addressing the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian occupation. 
            Key aspirations include the end of Israeli occupation, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, the right of 
            return for refugees, recognition of Palestinian statehood, protection of religious sites, dismantling of Israeli settlements, and the safeguarding of human rights.
            Additionally, there's a call for internal unity, reconciliation, and international support for a just resolution to the conflict. The situation is complex, and these
            demands reflect the multifaceted nature of the issues at hand.

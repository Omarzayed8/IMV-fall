          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <p>
           I want to design an interactive website that is related to my palestinian culture. I was inspired by different things. One of the things I was inspired by is spot the difference games and I wanrted to design a game that is retaled to my palestinian background.In envisioning my interactive website rooted in Palestinian culture, I draw inspiration from a multitude of elements that encapsulate the richness of my heritage. One notable source of influence is the concept of "spot the difference" games, where players are challenged to discern subtle distinctions between images or scenarios.
           The idea behind incorporating this gaming concept into my website is to infuse an interactive and entertaining element that resonates with users while staying true to my Palestinian background. This approach not only serves as a means of engagement but also as a unique way to convey aspects of Palestinian culture, history, or daily life.

            <li>
                Items: I wanted to include a objects that represents that you can find at a palestinian household.As well as important sybmobls such as the key of return.
                The symbol of the key holds significant meaning in the context of the Nakba, as numerous Palestinians retained the keys to their homes when they were compelled to leave in 1948. This act of preserving keys has become a widespread representation of the longing and hope for return.
            </li>
            <li>Contents:The website is programmed to generate distinct responses depending on the outcome, whether it be winning or losing. This could involve displaying  messages.There's a hyperlink incorporated into the design that leads to another page or destination in the case of winning. This hyperlink could be embedded in a congratulatory message or a specific element on the page. Clicking on this link might take the user to a special page, perhaps one that acknowledges their victory, provides additional information, 
               or allows them to claim a page.

            <h2>Prototype and challanges </h2>
            <p>I faced several challenges during the process, particularly in comprehending JavaScript. The initial hurdle was understanding the placement of objects and their outcomes after clicking four keys. Additionally, navigating the order of commands and managing various responses posed difficulties.  </p>

                    To start my adventure, I knew I had to capture the essence of these two incredible cities. With the help of Figma, I sketched the iconic skylines of Toronto and Montreal, each defined by their unique landmarks and towering buildings.
                    My storybook wouldn't be complete without a nod to the major train stops that connected these two metropolises. I meticulously recreated the grandeur of Union Station in Toronto and Gare Central in Montreal, ensuring every architectural detail was brought to life.
                    Adding a touch of visual magic, I scattered stars across the pages and created majestic towers using simple shapes. The warm, inviting glow of yellow acted as a navigation tool, guiding the users through their journey.In a stroke of genius, I utilized a Figma plugin to transform my drawings into HTML code
                    And on the final page of my storybook, I unveiled a delightful surpriseâ€”a croissant crafted with precision using shapes and strokes.

                  I had some issues with figma into converting the figma file into html code. It ignored some of the elements as well as it converted some of the elements into a png format. Thereofre, Using plugin on Figma is not perfect tool.

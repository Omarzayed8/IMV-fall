        <h1>A Handmade Web by J.R Carpenter</h1>
        
        <div class="qa-container" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
            <h2>Q1: What is the thesis of this article?
                
               
                </h2>
            <p class="answer" id="answer1">A: According to Carpenter, the "handmade web" acts as a sort of resistance, which is the article's main argument. It is a way to combat the commercialization, corporatization, and standardization of the web due to the dominance of large global corporations, exclusive technology, and commercialized digital publications. Carpenter gave her story to emphasize her personal experience by saying"  Handmade web pages offer a more lasting representation of identity. While the QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge I still possess, I can no longer access its contents. In contrast, the handmade website remains accessible online and fully functional".</p>

            <h2>Q2: Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?</h2>
            <p class="answer" id="answer2"> The manually building and maintaining websites as well as taking part in creative web writing and art initiatives is a method to counteract the trends of a more commercialized web. It's an act of defiance against the ubiquity of proprietary software, read-only hardware, search engines, content management systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers that have taken over the internet environment.

                In other words, the "handmade web" is a response to the decline of the original web's values of individuality, creativity, and ownership of one's online identity. It challenges the notion that a small number of large corporations should have control over and ownership of the internet and instead highlights the value of individual expression and innovation. Therefore, It is an act of resistance.</p>

            <h2> Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the web?</h2>
            <p class="answer" id="answer3">Reflecting on the concept of drawing attention to the "physicality" of the web, reminds me of one favourite Flash game websites (G9G.com), that website had a strong self-reflection of identity. Because it used a non-standard layout, fonts, and interactive elements to challenge conventional web design aesthetics and engage the user in a more physical or sensory way. As well as efforts to document and preserve the history of the web, including archiving and re-creating old web pages to highlight the evolution and physical transformation of web design over time. Websites like Wix.com and Format lack a soul and identity and the fact everyone can use the same layout over and over makes the user's experience underwhelming and boring as well as contributes homogenization and commercialization of the online world.</p>

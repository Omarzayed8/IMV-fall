            <h2>Q1:Why does Laurel Schwulst Links to an external site. advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
            </h2>
            <p class="answer" id="answer1"> Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because social media sites prioritize advertising over their users' needs and happiness. She believes that in this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you but you. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for individuals to create websites to set the record straight on who they are and what they do. I agree with her because having your website gives you more control over your online presence and allows you to showcase your work and ideas in a way that aligns with your brand.

                Laurel Schwulst's support for individual websites over social media resonates deeply with me, and I agree with her. The amount of autonomy provided by personal websites is crucial, allowing developers to tweak every element without being constrained by platform laws or data protection concerns. The ownership of domain names and content not only creates a sense of permanency, but also opens up interesting monetization potential that social media sites sometimes prevent. Personal websites' independence, which is unaffected by platform disruptions, guarantees a long-lasting and robust digital presence. In a digital landscape increasingly shaped by commercial interests, the authenticity and genuine self-expression facilitated by personal websites offer a refreshing alternative. This creative freedom allows creators to shape the web's future and fosters more profound connections with their audience. It's a perspective that aligns with the desire for a more personalized, meaningful, and unbounded online experience.

            <p class="answer" id="answer2">My future website will be a digital representation of chaos, a dynamic canvas where thoughts and ideas intermingle in unpredictable patterns. Much like the ever-changing nature of chaos, the design will capture spontaneity and creativity, offering an experience that mirrors the evolving landscape of my thoughts. It will be a celebration of the unique and unexplored, inviting visitors to navigate through the untamed corners of my mind.
